# Liskov Substitution Principle
> Subtypes must be substitutable for their base type

LSP states that IS-A relationship is insufficient and should be replaced with IS-SUBSTITUTABLE for. This is inherently what polymorphism is about.

A common example could be square–rectangle/circle–ellipse problem.


### Detecting LSP violation
* Type checking
* Null checking
* Not implemented exception

### Benefits
* Keeps functionality intact
* Subclass can be treated as base-class
