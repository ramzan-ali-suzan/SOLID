# Interface Segregation Principle
> Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use

Prefer small, concise interface over large fat ones.

### Detecting LSP violation
* Large interface
* Not implemented exception
* Code uses just a small subset of a large interface

### Benefits
* Loose coupling
* Easier testing
