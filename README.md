# üß± SOLID Principles
SOLID is five fundamental principles of object-oriented design for loosely coupled, testable and maintainable software.

* [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](https://github.com/ramzan-ali-suzan/SOLID/tree/master/SRP)
* [Open/Closed Principle (OCP)](https://github.com/ramzan-ali-suzan/SOLID/tree/master/OCP)
* [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](https://github.com/ramzan-ali-suzan/SOLID/tree/master/LSP)
* [Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](https://github.com/ramzan-ali-suzan/SOLID/tree/master/ISP)
* [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](https://github.com/ramzan-ali-suzan/SOLID/tree/master/DIP)

## Why SOLID matters?
Because poor software quality costs more than $150 billion per year in U.S. and greater than $500 billion per year worldwide. - Capers Jones

## Usage Instructions
This repository contains examples of the five SOLID principles. The examples are written in C#. Each principle has associate `Console` project and branches, like `SRP` for Single Responsibility Principle, with branches `srp-violation` and `srp-re-factored` to demonstrate violation and adherence to the principle, respectively.
