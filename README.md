# ðŸ§± SOLID Principles
SOLID is five fundamental principles of object-oriented design for loosely coupled, testable and maintainable software.

* **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP)
* **O**pen/Closed Principle (OCP)
* **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
* **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP)
* **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

This repository contains examples of the five SOLID principles. The examples are written in C#. Each principle has associate branch, like "srp-re-factored" and "srp-violation" to demonstrate adherence to and violation of the principle, respectively.
