# ðŸ§± SOLID Principles
SOLID is five fundamental principles of object-oriented design for loosely coupled, testable and maintainable software.

* [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](https://github.com/ramzan-ali-suzan/SOLID/tree/master/SRP)
* [Open/Closed Principle (OCP)](https://github.com/ramzan-ali-suzan/SOLID/tree/master/OCP)
* [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](https://github.com/ramzan-ali-suzan/SOLID/tree/master/LSP)
* [Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](https://github.com/ramzan-ali-suzan/SOLID/tree/master/ISP)
* [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](https://github.com/ramzan-ali-suzan/SOLID/tree/master/DIP)

This repository contains examples of the five SOLID principles. The examples are written in C#. Each principle has associate branch, like "srp-re-factored" and "srp-violation" to demonstrate adherence to and violation of the principle, respectively.
